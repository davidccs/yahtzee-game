# Yahtzee

# Description
Yahtzee is a classic dice game that involves strategy and luck. It is played with five dice and a scorecard. The objective of the game is to score points by rolling different combinations of dice.

# How to Play
At the beginning of each turn, the player rolls all five dice.
After the first roll, the player can choose to keep any number of dice and reroll the rest.
After the second roll, the player can once again choose to keep any number of dice and reroll the remaining.
After the third roll, the player must choose a category to score their roll in. The scorecard consists of various categories such as ones, twos, threes, full house, small straight, large straight, and Yahtzee (five of a kind), among others.
Once the category is chosen, the player records their score for that category on the scorecard.
The next player takes their turn, and the game continues until all players have filled out their scorecards.
The player with the highest total score at the end of the game wins.
Score Calculation
The score for each category is calculated differently. Here are some examples:

Ones, Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives, and Sixes: The player's score is the sum of the dice that match the category. For example, if the player has three twos, they would score 6 points
